# Logging-System
C++ logging system provides an easy way to log messages with contextual information such as log level, file name, function name, and line number. It supports different log levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR, DEBUG) for better tracking and debugging of applications. The system uses a simple macro (LOG) to streamline logging in your code.

## Features

- **Log Levels**: Supports multiple log levels, including `DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING`, and `ERROR`.
- **Contextual Information**: Automatically includes the file name, function name, and line number in each log message.
- **Macro Integration**: Uses a simple `LOG` macro to make logging easy and seamless in your project.
- **Formatted Output**: Logs are formatted for readability, with clear distinction of log levels and context.
- **Colored Output**: Log messages are color-coded based on the log level for better readability (e.g., green for INFO, red for ERROR).
