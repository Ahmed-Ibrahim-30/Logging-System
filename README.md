# Logging-System
C++ logging system provides an easy way to log messages with contextual information such as log level, file name, function name, and line number. It supports different log levels (e.g., INFO, ERROR, DEBUG) for better tracking and debugging of applications. The system uses a simple macro (LOG) to streamline logging in your code.
